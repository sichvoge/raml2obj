# Contributing
raml2obj is an open source project and your contribution is very much appreciated. Since raml2obj is
maintained by a very limited number of people, we ask you to please keep these rules in mind.

## Questions
If you have a question, please use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) instead of creating an issue.

## Bugs
If you found a bug, instead of creating a new issue, please create a failing unit test and send in a pull request.
It would be even better if you could include the fix as well :)

## Feature requests
Check for open issues or open a new issue to start a discussion around an idea. A pull request with actual code to
look at would be even more welcome!

## Workflow
1. Fork the repository on Github and make your changes on the **develop** branch (or branch off of it).
3. Add unit tests, run them with `npm run test`
3. Run `npm run lint` before committing to check for common problems and auto format all code.
4. Send a pull request (with the develop branch as the target).

## Thanks
A big thank you goes out to everyone who helped with the project, the [contributors](https://github.com/raml2html/raml2obj/graphs/contributors)
and everyone who took the time to report issues and give feedback.
